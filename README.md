# Visualizing the Impact of the Thomas Fire Using False Color Imagery
 
## About
This repository is dedicated to visualizing the impact of the Thomas Fire, which burned over 280,000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in December 2017. By utilizing satellite-based false color imagery from remote sensing data, this project highlights the fire scar, burn severity, and vegetation health.
 
## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
 
/data: Contains raw files of the Landsat satellite and the exported shapefile of the Thomas Fire perimeter.
 
README.md: This file provides an overview of the repository and how to use it.
 
Notebook1: Creates the Thomas Fire perimeter polygon and saves the .shp in the data folder. Notebook2: Analysis of the impact of the Thomas Fire.
 
## Data
The data used in this project comes from: 1. Landsat satellite imagery, used to create false color images
2. California fire perimeters. Contains all fire perimeters in the state of California.
 
Data access: The raw Landsat data used in this project is not directly included in the repository due to its large size. However, instructions for downloading the data can be found in the notebooks directory.
How to access: Users can access Landsat data through USGS Earth Explorer and the fire perimeters through the Catalog.data.gov
